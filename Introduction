LLD(LOW LEVEL DESIGN)


Low-Level Design (LLD) plays a crucial role in software development, transforming high-level abstract concepts into detailed, actionable components that developers can use to build the
system.

 It serves as a detailed blueprint that transforms the high-level architectural design into a concrete, step-by-step plan for developers to build the system.
